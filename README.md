# CS-300 Portfolio
The biggest problem I was solving in the projects for this course was properly building and running my code. I ran into many problems trying to correct errors on replit which was the main reason my cpp files would not properly run or build, but I think in my final project (project two) I was able to overcome this obstacle with the help of online resources and the SNHU tutoring services, as well as my professor. I think the project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs in many ways such as increasing my ability to problem solve and not over analyze the problem in front of me. Also, I think my coding skills have greatly increased, as well as my ability to understand what I am building in the code. I think my work on this project evolved the way I write programs that are maintanable, readable, and adaptable, because I found the project requires organization, managing your time wisely, and the multiple assignments that build the project one step at a time throughout the weeks also were very helpful.
